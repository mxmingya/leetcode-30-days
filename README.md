Day 8: find middle in a linkedlist, two pointers. <br/>
day 19 :search in sorted array - binary search<br/>
Day 25: jump game, running sum - array<br/>
ay 27: classic 2d DP. <br/>

Season2 :
Day3: using hashmap to check if characters match and enough. <br/>
Day4: if we add all the 2's exponential numbers, then we get 1111111111, use 1s to minus input num to get the results.  <br/>
Day6: use (len+1)/2 to handle [5,6,6] cases. <br/>
Day 7  :  cousins in binary tree, pay  attention to how the cousins are defined to set the check conditions.  <br/>
Day 8 : use multiplication instead of division to compare slope. SMART! <br/> 
Day 9 : remember to take into considerations of edge cases. <br/>
Day 10: dfs, use visited[i][j];
Day 11: xor, a number xor itself returns 1. <br>
Day 12: use stack to add numbers by orders. answer copied from discussion <br/>
Day 13: Implement Trie. <br/>
